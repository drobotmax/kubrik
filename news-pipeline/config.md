## Classification Rules

### When to update KB (actionable)
- **spec_change**: platform officially changed character limits, API specs, technical requirements
- **policy_update**: new ad policy rules, restrictions, compliance requirements
- **new_feature**: new ad format, campaign type, targeting option, measurement tool
- **deprecation**: feature being removed, API sunset, format discontinued

### When NOT to update KB (notify only)
- Industry commentary or opinion pieces
- Case studies or best practices (unless they reveal undocumented features)
- Conference announcements without specific product changes
- Blog posts about general trends
- Telegram posts without official source reference

### Confidence rules
- Official blog post (Google, Meta, Yandex) -> high confidence, can update specs
- Help Center / documentation update -> highest confidence
- Telegram channel post -> low confidence, notify_only unless links to official source
- If confidence < 80% -> classify as notify_only, flag for human review
